Data Analysis Project: SQL + Python

Project Overview:
This project showcases data analysis skills using SQL and Python to extract, transform, and analyze business data. 
The primary goal of this project is to:

Analyze customer purchase behaviors.
Calculate metrics such as retention rates, product correlations, and average orders.
Visualize insights derived from the data using Python.
We analyze various metrics using SQL for querying and Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for advanced analysis and visualization.

Data Sources:
The project uses the following datasets:

Technologies Used:
SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL): Used to query and manipulate the data stored in a relational database.
Python: Used for data manipulation and visualization.
Pandas: For data loading, cleaning, and transformation.
NumPy: For numerical operations and correlation calculations.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive data analysis and exploration.
Git: For version control.

Key Analysis and Insights:-
Customer Retention:

Calculated the retention rate of customers who made another purchase within 6 months after their first order.
Product Correlation:

Examined the correlation between product prices and the number of purchases. A negative correlation suggests price-sensitive customers.
Average Orders Per City:

Grouped customers by city and calculated the average number of orders per customer.
Revenue Breakdown:

Visualized the percentage revenue contribution by different product categories.
