# **S&P 500 Stock Time Series Analysis**
This project analyzes the time series data of selected companies from the S&P 500 index. 
The notebook processes and visualizes stock data over a period of five years for companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft, leveraging Python libraries for data handling and visualization.

## **Project Overview**
The S&P 500 Stock Time Series Analysis project focuses on loading, processing, and analyzing historical stock price data for multiple S&P 500 companies. 
Through Python's robust data science libraries, we can observe historical trends, derive important financial insights, and build a foundation for predictive modeling.

## **Objective:**
### **Data Preparation:** 
Load and clean stock price data (adjusted close, high, low, volume, etc.).
### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
Visualize trends, price fluctuations, and volume shifts across different companies.
### **Time Series Analysis:** 
Basic analysis of the time series data, aiming for deeper insights into price behavior.

## **Key Features**
### **Multi-Company Stock Data Analysis:** 
Analyze the historical stock data of multiple S&P 500 companies.
### **Time Series Visualization:** 
Plot stock price movements, volatility, and volume using matplotlib and seaborn.
### **Data Flexibility:** 
The project reads from multiple CSV files, making it easy to analyze any number of companies.
### **Warning Management:** 
Filter out irrelevant warnings to focus on analysis.

## **Data Overview**
The project uses historical stock data in CSV format. Each file corresponds to a single company and contains the following columns:
- **Date:** The date of the record
- **Open:** The price of the stock at the market open
- **High:** The highest price during the trading day
- **Low:** The lowest price during the trading day
- **Close:** The closing price at the end of the trading day
- **Volume:** The number of shares traded
- **Adjusted Close:** The closing price adjusted for corporate actions such as stock splits and dividends

## Dependencies
The project uses the following libraries:

- **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy:** For numerical operations.
- **matplotlib:** For data visualization.
- **seaborn:** For enhanced visualizations.
- **glob:** For handling file paths.
- **warnings:** To manage and suppress unnecessary warnings.


## **Future Enhancements**
**Forecasting Models:** Implement ARIMA, Prophet, or other models to predict future stock prices.

**Expanded Analysis:** Include additional financial metrics like moving averages, Bollinger Bands, etc.

**Dashboard:** Create a web-based dashboard for real-time stock tracking using libraries like dash or streamlit.
